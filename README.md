# GPSDO-Monitoring
Monitoring, measuring and logging data from a high precision 10MHz GPS disciplined oscillator (GPSDO)

This section is currently under development.

The files I uploaded are files that work, but may still undergo changes. During this process, I will overwrite the files with a newer version, and will NOT keep the old ones here.

Details are or will be in my Blog, also under development.  http://www.paulvdiyblogs.net/2020/10/monitoring-measuring-logging-gpsdo.html

Versions of the pdf diagrams I am now working from are called V2. Look at the Blog for more details.

Note that all these files are bound to change!
