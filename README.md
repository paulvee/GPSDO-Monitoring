# GPSDO-Monitoring
Monitoring, measuring and logging data from a high precision 10MHz GPS disciplined oscillator (GPSDO)

This section is currently under development.

The files I uploaded are test files that work, but are not completely done yet. 
Details are or will be in my Blog, also under development.  http://www.paulvdiyblogs.net/2020/10/monitoring-measuring-logging-gpsdo.html


mail_ocxo_log.py 
is the script that emails the log file just before mid-night to my local PC.

mail_counter_log.py 
is the scipt that emails the counter log file to my email account.

mail_nmea_log.py 
is the mail program that sends me the logs to my account.

add-on counter.jpg and add-on RPi.jpg are the circuit diagrams I'm working from at the moment.
Note that I cannot get the Raspberry Pi Zero-W wireless connection to work inside or even near the GPSDO. Version 2 of the pdf diagrams are now the next attempt. Look at the Blog for more details.

Note that all these files are bound to change!
